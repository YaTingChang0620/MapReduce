<h1>MapReduce Patterns and Use Cases</h1>

## Basic MapReduce Patterns
1. Counting and Summing
2. Collating:
  * Inverted Index
3. Filtering, Parsing, and Validation
4. Distributed Task Execution
  * Performance Testing
5. Sorting
  * Secondary Sorting

## Not-So-Basic MapReduce Patterns
1. Iterative Message Passing (Graph Processing)
  * Availability Propagation Through The Tree of Categories
  * Breadth-First Search
2. Distinct Values (Unique Items Counting)
  * Unique Users Counting
3. Cross-Correlation
  * Market Analysis (customers who buy this tend to also buy that)
