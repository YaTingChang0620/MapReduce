<h1>MapReduce Patterns and Use Cases</h1>

## Basic MapReduce Patterns

#### Counting and Summing
#### Collating
<ol type="1"> 
   <li> Inverted Index</li>
</ol>

#### Filtering, Parsing, and Validation
#### Distributed Task Execution
<ol type = "1"> 
  <li>Performance Testing</li>
</ol> 
#### Sorting
<ol type = "1"> 
  <li>Secondary Sorting</li>
</ol> 

## Not-So-Basic MapReduce Patterns
1. Iterative Message Passing (Graph Processing)
  * Availability Propagation Through The Tree of Categories
  * Breadth-First Search
2. Distinct Values (Unique Items Counting)
  * Unique Users Counting
3. Cross-Correlation
  * Market Analysis (customers who buy this tend to also buy that)
